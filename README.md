# AI & the Web: Understanding and managing the impact of Machine Learning models on the Web

This repository hosts discussions on the systemic impact of AI systems, and Machine Learning models in particular, on the Web, based on [a write-up of the W3C Team current shared understanding](https://w3c.github.io/ai-web-impact/) of this space.

We invite the community to complete or correct that analysis by raising issues on the repository - please make sure these are focused on topics where the impact of AI systems can be qualified of systemic, and ideally, where a coordinated or standardized approach can have an effect.
